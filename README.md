Chrome extension for testing the speed of current webpage.

Steps to use:
1. Type 'chrome://extensions' in a tab to bring up the extensions page.
2. Once on this page, check “Developer mode” to enable loading unpacked extensions. This will allow you to load your extension from a folder. Finally, click “Load unpacked extension” or simply drag the “GTmetrix Extension” folder onto the page to load up the extension. You should immediately see the extension show up as a Browser Action with your icon in the toolbar window of the current tab.
3. To test out the extension, navigate to a page you want to test with GTmetrics. Then, go ahead and click the icon for our GTmetrix extension. When the HTML page comes up, click “Check this page now!” and you should immediately see the request and results from the current page being displayed.

That's it!
